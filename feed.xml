In this book, Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski provide many evidence-based examples of how we humans, in the past and in the 21st century, have developed many (peculiar) behaviors that are triggered by reminders of our mortality. Connecting the “terror management” framework the authors describe in this work with the increasingly relevant discussions in the artificial intelligence community concerning consciousness and agency seems like an important next step for humanity to take, and I believe this book’s authors have done a superb job distilling terror management theory’s main findings into a format most people can easily digest and relate to. If you are interested in peering behind your own layers of consciousness and mortality, give this book a try.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/the-worm-at-the-core.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="gut-instinct">Gut instinct</h2> <p>How often do you rely on gut feelings to make important decisions in your life? After reading Malcolm Gladwell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink:_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking">Blink</a>, you might think twice. This book argues for the importance of examining how potent pattern recognition can be for enacting both positive and negative events in society.

But this task isn’t as easy as it may sound: we humans have a history of “defaulting to trust”, which sometimes leads us to completely misread critical situations and the intentions of various historical figures. So should we simply “default to distrust”? Most likely not: just think about how difficult it would be to organize society around this principle. Instead, through this book, Gladwell argues that we should acknowledge the limitations of “truth-defaulting behavior” yet remain optimistic of its cooperation-promoting spirit.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/05_2025/talking-to-strangers.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="a-seaward-novella">A seaward novella</h2> <p>Hemingway’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea">The Old Man and the Sea</a> tells the tale of Santiago and his (long) journey to catch a giant marlin.

Fortunately, the author (Peter Wohlleben) of <a href="https://www.peterwohllebenbooks.com/the-hidden-life-of-trees">The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate</a> knows how to ground readers in relation to the world around them.

This journey of the ego passes through four key ideas presented in <a href="https://www.miguelruiz.com/the-four-agreements/">The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom</a>: the importance of (1) being impeccable with our word, (2) not taking things personally, (3) not making assumptions, and (4) always doing our best.

In this competitive landscape, timing is nearly everything, and being left behind can be detrimental for one’s continued career in science. Moreover, one is often seen as a scientific thought leader for being the first to publicize a novel insight or development, which is likely a positive thing. However, in this post, I would like to challenge readers (and certainly myself) to expand one’s viewpoint on this topic, as the future of science (and life) depends, in part, on how we normalize the pace of our work.</p> <h2 id="slow-carb-science">Slow carb science</h2> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality">Seasonality</a> is a core component of <a href="https://calnewport.com/my-new-book-slow-productivity/">slow productivity</a>, a rebuttal to the annual trend of increasing the pace of our lives. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many knowledge workers (not only researchers) could identify the impact that full-time remote work had on their sense of personal and professional sustainability. Burnout (an opaquely defined concept, which may be related to a long-term misalignment with one’s values) gripped many individuals and drove them to seek new work arrangements or lifestyles. However, the scientific (work) “treadmill” continued (and continues) to zoom forward. If we are to identify a sustainable means of structuring our work, we must start with the fundamental questions, “What are my values?” and “Am I OK as is?”. If the answer to either is fuzzy, we are most likely treading through our lives with “unstable footing” (as I have often experienced for myself). Moreover, I argue that the nature of the work we choose to do (and ultimately may accomplish) is a function of these values and self-views (e.g., a short-term value system may lead to narrow and uninspired research).</p> <p>It takes tremendous courage and commitment to adopt a <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-guides/foundations-course-design/learning-activities/growth-mindset-and-enhanced-learning">growth mindset</a> not just for our professional lives <em>but also for our relationships and personal development</em>. Part of this growth may include honestly assessing what we want out of life (by way of our value system) and what we are willing to give up for the loved ones in our lives (also part of our value system). In these internal dialogues, it is easy to mistake one of our many <a href="https://ifs-institute.com/">parts</a> for <em>ourselves</em>, which underscores how important it is for us to intentionally bake in an <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/">integration</a> practice into our daily schedules. This has become an essential part of my daily routine, and I recommend those interested in learning more to explore frameworks such as Internal Family Systems or the Enneagram to discover more of what may be waiting to be discovered. As we discover more of our core values and patterns, we can begin to do the hard work of integrating our personalities through relationships and professional commitments built on intentionality and vision.</p> <h2 id="strategic-splurges">Strategic splurges</h2> <p>With deep insights about ourselves and those in our lives, we can start practicing seasonality in all its richness, <a href="https://calnewport.com/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/">deeply working</a> with the time we’ve allotted to the task of building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwOdU02SE0w">career capital</a> and investing in our chosen communities. As in nature, there are times for scurry and times for limited hurry, and the ratio of the two should hopefully be small and predictable (to some degree). In fact, this intrinsic pacing may yield <em>better</em> and faster results in our professional pursuits due to increased clarity (i.e., not fooling ourselves and letting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">gradient descent</a> lead the way). It’s hard to imagine such a trajectory played out in our lives will not impact what kinds of work we choose to spend our limited time on.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p><strong>Alex</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Musings"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Philosophy"/><category term="Inquiry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A naive musing on the philosophy of scientific research and beyond.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The principles of tomorrow</title><link href="https://jiehyeh.github.io/blog/2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The principles of tomorrow"/><published>2025-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jiehyeh.github.io/blog/2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jiehyeh.github.io/blog/2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow/"><![CDATA[<div class="l-page"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-principles-of-tomorrow.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>What do artificial intelligence, hedge funds, and personality frameworks have in common?

In particular, this book details how its founders intentions of crafting a culture of radical transparency traded the common (comfortable) business practice of “saving face” by withholding one’s true opinions of business decisions for the incredible financial and professional growth the fund has achieved over the last several decades. In short, operating a business from a culture of mutually-assured accountability is far from an easy task, but Bridgewater stands as a case study of the power of this approach to leadership in the world of business and beyond.

The Myers-Briggs framework offers a well-researched pathway to elucidating your personality traits, whereas the Enneagram promotes an intrinsic and somatic approach to self-discovery. Specifically, the Enneagram features nine key personality centers that individuals identify with to varying degrees, and each type typically integrates (or disintegrates) to another type in states of personality “balance” (imbalance). These integration pathways offer Enneagram practitioners a unique way to develop more “balance” in one’s relationships to others and self.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/02_2025/the-sacred-enneagram.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="staying-small">Staying small</h2> <p>Paul Jarvis asks the readers of his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business/dp/1328972356">Company of One</a> to reconsider one’s definition of success in business.

I personally think the live audio series version of this work is even easier to connect with than perhaps a traditional book version would be, since it features stories and examples from audience members’ lives that help illustrate the basic principles introduced in this work.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-7-habits-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-7-habits-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-7-habits-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/10_2024/the-7-habits.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="a-meaningfull-life">A meaningful(l) life</h2> <p>As a world-renowned treatise on human suffering and resilence at its most extreme, Viktor Frankl’s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning"><em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em></a> characterizes one’s experience of an existential meaning crisis precisely.

This second novel spends a great deal of time uniquely exploring what happens after the heroes have won and have a new society to (re)build. The narrative structure no longer centers solely on Vin’s experience and instead expands to capture the psychologies and philosophies of the surrounding cast of characters, even in the midst of dire straits. Overall, this entry showcases Sanderson’s ability to repeatedly enthrall a readership with expansive world building and character analysis.</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/well-of-ascension-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/well-of-ascension-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/well-of-ascension-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/well-of-ascension.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="how-long-will-this-streak-last">How long will this streak last?</h2> <p>Taleb’s venerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable"><em>The Black Swan</em></a> has captured the attention of many astute and experienced practitioners of probability, planning, and investing. More importantly, it’s a charming yet chilling reminder of how blind we as a society are to rare (though technically probable) events. By default, we simply are not prepared for unexpected deviations from the “everyday norm”, largely as a function of our wiring for homeostatis (understandly so). However, Taleb urges his readers to make themselves personally and professionally robust against “black swan” events by (<em>full stop</em>) not trying to predict them in the first place!</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/the-black-swan-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/the-black-swan-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/the-black-swan-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/the-black-swan.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <h2 id="the-internal-families-we-all-house">The internal families we all house</h2> <p><a href="https://ifs-institute.com/">Internal Family Systems</a> (IFS) is a blossoming topic in pop psychology today, yet its roots are over 40 years old, thanks to pioneers such as Richard Schwartz. To round out the month of July with a dose of “internal” work, I listened to the introductory IFS audiobook <a href="https://ifs-institute.com/nobadparts"><em>No Bad Parts</em></a> narrated partially by Schwartz himself. This book challenges many preconceived notions many of us have regarding “mono-mind theory” (i.e., the idea we are of one fixed personality at all times) while introducing readers to a new way of understanding oneself in light of a “family” of interacting personalities, each of different internal ages and (e.g., protective) wants and desires. Those interested in acquiring a new framework for understanding oneself and others may find this introduction to IFS helpful (and perhaps even transformative).</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/no-bad-parts-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/no-bad-parts-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/no-bad-parts-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_post_images/08_2024/no-bad-parts.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>That’s all from me this month.

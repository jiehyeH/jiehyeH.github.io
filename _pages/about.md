Welcome! <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdHZ3ZWJwdWd5MDMydTN0NzBobHcxaHNjbHl5MHMxYnBlaHJjZ2cxNCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9cw/OP4C9oeeSVIrwgFNAk/giphy.gif" width="40">

I study astronomy and astrophysics at the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://nd.edu/'>University of Notre Dame</a>. As a Galactic Archaeologist, I explore the history of the Milky Way, nearby dwarf galaxies, and the Andromeda galaxy by analyzing the stellar chemodynamical properties. <br>
With my advisor, Prof. Evan Kirby, I use <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/jiehyeH/M31_Fe_Mg_estimation'>machine learning</a> along with photometric and spectroscopic data to examine the chemical abundance distribution and the formation histories of distant stars. 
I also work with my other advisor, Prof. Timothy Beers, on using large-scale photometric surveys combined with machine learning to analyze carbon estimates in ancient stars of the Milky Way and look for traces of the first stars. <br>
I started my Ph.D. in 2021 and expect to graduate in 2026. Before that, I did my M.S. in astronomy (2016–2019) and a B.S. in Earth science education (2012–2016), both at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.

Want to know a bit more about me?
In 2019–2020, I took a break from school and spent a year on a working holiday in Victoria, Canada 🇨🇦. I love traveling and learning about different cultures ✈️. I’m a big fan of the ocean (I can't swim tho) and enjoy summer to Lake Michigan 🏖️. I’m a dog person 🐶, and I like playing piano and guitar in my free time.
I also enjoy sharing moments from my Ph.D. life on <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://blog.naver.com/hjihye1993'>my blog</a>.
